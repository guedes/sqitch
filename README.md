App/Sqitch version 0.932
=======================

This application, `sqitch`, will provide a simple yet robust interface for SQL
change management. The philosophy and functionality is covered over a series
of blog posts published in January, 2012:

* [Simple SQL Change Management](http://justatheory.com/computers/databases/simple-sql-change-management.html)
* [VCS-Enabled SQL Change Management](http://justatheory.com/computers/databases/vcs-sql-change-management.html)
* [SQL Change Management Sans Duplication](http://justatheory.com/computers/databases/sql-change-management-sans-redundancy.html)

But it's not there yet. It's under heavy development. Hopefully it will be
quasi-usable soon, as there is
[a deadline](http://www.pgcon.org/2012/schedule/events/479.en.html). Watch
this space.
