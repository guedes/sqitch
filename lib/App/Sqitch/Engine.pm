=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Engine - Sqitch Deployment Engine

=head1 Synopsis

  my $engine = App::Sqitch::Engine->new( sqitch => $sqitch );

=head1 Description

App::Sqitch::Engine provides the base class for all Sqitch storage engines.
Most likely this will not be of much interest to you unless you are hacking on
the engine code.

=head1 Interface

=head3 Class Methods

=head3 C<config_vars>

  my %vars = App::Sqitch::Engine->config_vars;

Returns a hash of names and types to use for configuration variables for the
engine. These can be set under the C<core.$engine_name> section in any
configuration file.

The keys in the returned hash are the names of the variables. The values are
the data types. Valid data types include:

=over

=item C<any>

=item C<int>

=item C<num>

=item C<bool>

=item C<bool-or-int>

=back

Values ending in C<+> (a plus sign) may be specified multiple times. Example:

  (
      client  => 'any',
      db_name => 'any',
      host    => 'any',
      port    => 'int',
      set     => 'any+',
  )

In this example, the C<port> variable will be stored and retrieved as an
integer. The C<set> variable may be of any type and may be included multiple
times. All the other variables may be of any type.

By default, App::Sqitch::Engine returns an empty list. Subclasses for
supported engines will return more.

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<load>

  my $cmd = App::Sqitch::Engine->load(%params);

A factory method for instantiating Sqitch engines. It loads the subclass for
the specified engine and calls C<new>, passing the Sqitch object. Supported
parameters are:

=over

=item C<sqitch>

The App::Sqitch object driving the whole thing.

=back

=head3 C<new>

  my $engine = App::Sqitch::Engine->new(%params);

Instantiates and returns a App::Sqitch::Engine object.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<name>

  my $name = $engine->name;

The name of the engine. Defaults to the last part of the package name, so as a
rule you should not need to override it, since it is that string that Sqitch
uses to find the engine class.

=head3 C<destination>

  my $destination = $engine->destination;

Returns the name of the destination database. This will usually be the same as
the configured database name or the value of the C<--db-name> option. Hover,
subclasses may override it to provide other values, such as when neither of
the above have values but there is nevertheless a default value assumed by the
engine. Used internally to name the destination in status messages.

=head3 C<deploy>

  $engine->deploy($to_target);
  $engine->deploy($to_target, $mode);

Deploys changes to the destination database, starting with the current
deployment state, and continuing to C<$to_target>. C<$to_target> must be a
valid target specification as passable to the C<index_of()> method of
L<App::Sqitch::Plan>. If C<$to_target> is not specified, all changes will be
applied.

The second argument specifies the reversion mode in the case of deployment
failure. The allowed values are:

=over

=item C<all>

In the event of failure, revert all deployed changes, back to the point at
which deployment started. This is the default.

=item C<tag>

In the event of failure, revert all deployed changes to the last
successfully-applied tag. If no tags were applied during this deployment, all
changes will be reverted to the pint at which deployment began.

=item C<change>

In the event of failure, no changes will be reverted. This is on the
assumption that a change failure is total, and the change may be applied again.

=back

Note that, in the event of failure, if a reversion fails, the destination
database B<may be left in a corrupted state>. Write your revert scripts
carefully!

=head3 C<revert>

  $engine->revert($tag);

Reverts the L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Tag> from the database, including all of its
associated changes.

=head3 C<deploy_change>

  $engine->deploy_change($change);

Used internally by C<deploy()> to deploy an individual change.

=head3 C<revert_change>

  $engine->revert_change($change);

Used internally by C<revert()> (and, by C<deploy()> when a deploy fails) to
revert an individual change.

=head3 C<is_deployed>

  say "Tag deployed"  if $engine->is_deployed($tag);
  say "Change deployed" if $engine->is_deployed($change);

Convenience method that dispatches to C<is_deployed_tag()> or
C<is_deployed_change()> as appropriate to its argument.

=head3 C<earliest_change>

  my $change = $engine->earliest_change;

Returns the L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> object representing the earliest
applied change. With the optional C<$offset> argument, the returned change
will be the offset number of changes following the earliest change.


=head3 C<latest_change>

  my $change = $engine->latest_change;
  my $change = $engine->latest_change($offset);

Returns the L<App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> object representing the latest
applied change. With the optional C<$offset> argument, the returned change
will be the offset number of changes before the latest change.

=head2 Abstract Instance Methods

These methods must be overridden in subclasses.

=head3 C<begin_work>

  $engine->begin_work;

This method is called just before a change is deployed or reverted. It should
create a lock to prevent any other processes from making changes to the
database, to be freed in C<finish_work>.

=head3 C<finish_work>

  $engine->finish_work;

This method is called after a change has been deployed or reverted. It should
unlock the lock created by C<begin_work>.

=head3 C<initialized>

  $engine->initialize unless $engine->initialized;

Returns true if the database has been initialized for Sqitch, and false if it
has not.

=head3 C<initialize>

  $engine->initialize;

Initializes a database for Sqitch by installing the Sqitch metadata schema
and/or tables. Should be overridden by subclasses. This implementation throws
an exception

=head3 C<register_project>

  $engine->register_project;

Registers the current project plan in the database. The implementation should
insert the project name and URI if they have not already been inserted. If a
project with the same name but different URI already exists, an exception
should be thrown.

=head3 C<is_deployed_tag>

  say 'Tag deployed' if $engine->is_deployed_tag($tag);

Should return true if the L<tag|App::Sqitch::Plan::Tag> has been applies to
the database, and false if it has not.

=head3 C<is_deployed_change>

  say 'Change deployed' if $engine->is_deployed_change($change);

Should return true if the L<change|App::Sqitch::Plan::Change> has been
deployed to the database, and false if it has not.

=head3 C<change_id_for_depend>

  say 'Dependency satisfied' if $engine->change_id_for_depend($depend);

Returns the change ID for a L<dependency|App::Sqitch::Plan::Depend>, if the
dependency resolves to a change currently deployed to the database. Returns
C<undef> if the dependency resolves to no currently-deployed change.

=head3 C<changes_requiring_change>

  my @requiring = $engine->changes_requiring_change($change);

Returns a list of hash references representing currently deployed changes that
require the passed change. When this method returns one or more hash
references, the change should not be reverted. Each hash reference should
contain the following keys:

=over

=item C<change_id>

The requiring change ID.

=item C<change>

The requiring change name.

=item C<project>

The project the requiring change is from.

=item C<asof_tag>

Name of the first tag to be applied after the requiring change was deployed,
if any.

=back

=head3 C<log_deploy_change>

  $engine->log_deploy_change($change);

Should write to the database metadata and history the records necessary to
indicate that the change has been deployed.

=head3 C<log_fail_change>

  $engine->log_fail_change($change);
