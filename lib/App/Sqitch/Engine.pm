=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Engine - Sqitch Deployment Engine

=head1 Synopsis

  my $engine = App::Sqitch::Engine->new( sqitch => $sqitch );

=head1 Description

App::Sqitch::Engine provides the base class for all Sqitch storage engines.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<load>

  my $cmd = App::Sqitch::Engine->load(%params);

A factory method for instantiating Sqitch engines. It loads the subclass for
the specified engine and calls C<new>, passing the Sqitch object. Supported
parameters are:

=over

=item C<sqitch>

The App::Sqitch object driving the whole thing.

=back

=head3 C<new>

  my $engine = App::Sqitch::Engine->new(%params);

Instantiates and returns a App::Sqitch::Engine object.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<engine>

  my $name = $engine->name;

The name of the engine. Defaults to the last part of the package name, so as a
rule you should not need to override it, since it is that string that Sqitch
uses to find the engine class.

=head1 See Also

=over

=item L<sqitch>

The Sqitch command-line client.
