=head1 Name

App::Sqitch::Config - Sqitch configuration management

=head1 Synopsis

  my $config = App::Sqitch::Config->new;
  say scalar $config->dump;

=head1 Description

This class provides the interface to Sqitch configuration. It inherits from
L<Config::GitLike>, and therefore provides the complete interface of that
module.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<confname>

Returns the configuration file base name, which is F<sqitch.conf>.

=head3 C<system_file>

Returns the path to the system configuration file. The value returned will be
the contents of the C<$SQITCH_SYSTEM_CONFIG> environment variable, if it's
defined, or else C<$Config{prefix}/etc/sqitch.conf>.

=head3 C<global_file>

An alias for C<system_file()> for use by the parent class.

=head3 C<user_file>

Returns the path to the user configuration file. The value returned will be
the contents of the C<$SQITCH_USER_CONFIG> environment variable, if it's
defined, or else C<~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf>.

=head3 C<project_file>

Returns the path to the project configuration file, which is just
F<./sqitch.conf>, unless C<$SQITCH_CONFIG> is set, in which case its value
will be returned.

=head3 C<dir_file>

An alias for C<project_file()> for use by the parent class.

=head3 C<get_section>

  my $core = $config->get_section(section => 'core');
  my $pg   = $config->get_section(section => 'core.pg');

Returns a hash reference containing only the keys within the specified
section or subsection.
