sqitch-bundle - Bundle a Sqitch project for distribution

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] init project
  sqitch [options] init --uri uri project

=head1 Description

This command bundles up a sqitch project for distribution. At its simplest, it
copies the project configuration file, the plan file, and all of the change
scripts to a directory. This directory can then be packaged up for
distribution (as a tarball, RPM, etc.). Options allow for the list of changes
to be bundled to be a subset of the plan.

=head1 Options

file will be created in this directory, and the top, deploy, revert, and test

=item C<--from>

The change from which to start bundling. If you need to bundle up only a subset
of your plan, specify a change (using a supported L<change specification|sqitchchanges>

=item C<--to>

The change to which to end bundling. If you need to bundle up only a subset
